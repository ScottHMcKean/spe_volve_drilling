# SPE Mentorship Volve Drilling Data Project
This is a repo for an SPE Mentorship project. The goal of the project is to munge the Volve Drilling Data, which is preprocessed and available at the following location: https://www.ux.uis.no/~atunkiel/file_list.html. Files are released under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

To make things easier we are going to use the preprocessed depth files (this also makes the files much smaller). There will already be enough data munging and analytics using those.

# Data downloads
To keep the repository lightweight, we are going to use pandas to download the raw files via url.
